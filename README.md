Description:

We classify 50 different sounds (Kaggle ESC50 dataset) ranging from animal sounds, natural soundscapes and water sounds, human sounds, interior/domestic and exterior/urban noises. We employ various techniques including data augmentation, vectorizing audio as MFCC features and deep learning CNN models. We achieved 94% test validation accuracy outperforming expert listeners (90% accuracy). Please refer to the report and Jupyter notebook below for implementation details.
